      <p>
        <strong>Machine learning</strong> is a subset of <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> in the field of computer science that often uses statistical techniques
        to give computers the ability to "learn" (i.e., progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data,
        <strong>without</strong> being <strong>explicitly programmed</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Machine learning is closely related to (and often overlaps with) computational statistics, which also focuses on prediction-making
        through the use of computers. It has strong ties to mathematical optimization, which delivers methods, theory and application
        domains to the field. Machine learning is sometimes conflated with data mining, where the latter subfield focuses more on
        exploratory data analysis and is known as unsupervised learning. Machine learning can also be unsupervised
        and be used to learn and establish baseline behavioral profiles for various entities and then used to find meaningful anomalies.

        Machine learning tasks are typically classified into two broad categories, depending on whether there is a learning "signal" or
        "feedback" available to a learning system:

        <h1>Languages used</h1>
      </header>

      <p>Artificial intelligence researchers have developed several specialized programming languages for artificial intelligence:</p>

      <ul>

        <li>
          <strong>Python</strong> is widely used for artificial intelligence, with packages for a number of applications including General AI,
          Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Neural Networks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>R</strong> is widely used in new-style artificial intelligence, involving statistical computations, numerical analysis,
          the use of Bayesian inference, neural networks and in general Machine Learning. In domains like finance, biology,
          sociology or medicine it is considered as one of the main standard language.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lisp</strong> is a practical mathematical notation for computer programs based on lambda calculus. Linked lists are one of the
          Lisp language's major data structures, and Lisp source code is itself made up of lists.
          There are many dialects of Lisp in use today, among which are Common Lisp, Scheme, and Clojure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Haskell</strong> is also a very good programming language for AI. Lazy evaluation and the list and LogicT monads make it easy to express
          non-deterministic algorithms, which is often the case. Infinite data structures are great for search trees. The
          language's features enable a compositional way of expressing the algorithms. The only drawback is that working with graphs
          is a bit harder at first because of purity.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some other languages used for machine learning are:
      <ul>
        <li>C++</li>
        <li>Perl</li>
        <li>MATLAB</li>
        <li>Prolog</li>
        <li>Julia</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The foremost question when trying to understand a field such as Machine Learning is the amount of maths necessary and the complexity of maths required to
        understand these systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        The answer to this question is multidimensional and depends on the level and interest of the individual.

        Here is the minimum level of mathematics that is needed for Machine Learning Engineers / Data Scientists.

    <section class="main-section" id="Steps_of_machine_learning">

      <header><h1>Steps of machine learning</h1></header>

      <p>There are five basic steps of machine learning:</p>

      <ol>

        <li>
          <strong>Collecting data:</strong> <br>Be it the raw data from excel, access, text files etc., this step (gathering past data) forms the
          foundation of the future learning. The better the variety, density and volume of relevant data, better the
          learning prospects for the machine becomes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Preparing the data:</strong> <br>Any analytical process thrives on the quality of the data used. One needs to spend time determining the
          quality of data and then taking steps for fixing issues such as missing data and treatment of outliers.
          Exploratory analysis is perhaps one method to study the nuances of the data in details thereby burgeoning the nutritional
          content of the data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Training a model:</strong> <br>This step involves choosing the appropriate algorithm and representation of data in the form of the model.
          The cleaned data is split into two parts – train and test (proportion depending on the prerequisites); the first part
          (training data) is used for developing the model. The second part (test data), is used as a reference.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Evaluating the model:</strong> <br>To test the accuracy, the second part of the data (holdout / test data) is used. This step determines the
          precision in the choice of the algorithm based on the outcome. A better test to check accuracy of model is to see its performance
          on data which was not used at all during model build.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Improving the performance:</strong> <br>This step might involve choosing a different model altogether or introducing more variables to
          augment the efficiency. That’s why significant amount of time needs to be spent in data collection and preparation.
        </li>
